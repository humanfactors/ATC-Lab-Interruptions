## Background

## Basic Overview

## Simulator Information
ATC Lab Advanced is an experimental air traffic control simulator used for Human
Factors Psychology research. The ATC task simulates work domains where
individuals must continuously monitor multi-item dynamic displays, such as ATC,
naval radar tracking, and air battle management. Participants assume the role of
an air traffic controller responsible for maintaining the operational safety of
aircraft in a sector and must complete various ongoing activities including
accepting aircraft entering their sector, detecting and resolving aircraft
conflicts, and handing-off aircraft exiting their sector.
