	Simulation Experiment</h1>
	
	<p class="infotext">Welcome to the Air Traffic Control Simulator Experiment. In this experiment you will 
	complete a task that is similar to the popular mobile game, “Flight Control”. <br /> <br />The entire session will last approximately 120 minutes. Please put your phone 
	on silent and place it in your bag before continuing.
	<br /><br />This training program will teach you how to keep an air traffic control sector operating safely. By the end of the training you will understand:<br /></p>
	<ul class="infobullets">
	<li>What a flight control sector is.</li>
	<li>How to read an aircraft information box.</li>
	<li>How to accept and handoff aircraft (and what these tasks are).</li>
	<li>How to identify and resolve conflicts (and what this task is).</li>
	<li>How to manage potential disruptions.</li>
	</ul><p class="infotext">
	Read the information in this training carefully, however it should not take you longer than 15 minutes to get to the end. If you are stuck on a concept, please do not hesitate to contact the experimenter.<br />
