	1. The Sector Display</p>
	<p class="desctext">
	The light grey polygon in the image below is your flight 
	control sector. You are responsible for aircraft entering this area, leaving 
	this area, and flying within this area. The dark grey zone represents areas outside of your control.
	The black lines are the flight paths which aircraft will travel on. Aircraft 
	will only travel on these pre-designated paths.</p>
	<p class="desctext">
	In the bottom of the screen is a timer. Scenarios go for 5 minutes each. The 
	number on the right of the screen (currently -10) shows how many points you 
	have. You are awarded points for successfully completing 
	objectives, and points are deducted for failing objectives.</p>

	2. Identifying Aircraft</p>
	<p class="desctext">
	The image below shows an example aircraft.
	Aircraft are represented as coloured circles with a line. The line tells you 
	what direction the aircraft is travelling in. We will tell you more about colour soon.</p>
	<p class="desctext">
	Aircraft have an information box. The first bit of text (from top left) is the 
	name of the aircraft, e.g. <span class="auto-aircraft">MH22</span>. 
	Next to this, you have the speed of the aircraft in knots, e.g.
	<span class="auto-aircraft">45<s>0</s></span>. Under this is the type of aircraft, 
	e.g. <span class="auto-aircraft">A320</span>.
	The text at the bottom relates to aircraft altitude and has three parts: 
	</p>
	
		
		<ul  class="infobullets"><li>The aircraft's current flight level in feet 
			(ft)</li>
		<li>An arrow indicating whether the aircraft is descending (<strong class="auto-aircraft">V</strong>), climbing 
	(<strong class="auto-aircraft">^</strong>), or not changing altitude (<strong class="auto-aircraft">&gt;</strong>).<li>
			The second number indicates the altitude the aircraft cleared to change to. 
	</ul>	
		
	
	<p class="figure">
	Example 2. The 
	aircraft starts at <span class="auto-aircraft">36,000 ft</span>. Then it starts climbing to 
	<span class="auto-aircraft">37,00 ft</span>. Note, when the aircraft is not 
	changing altitude, both numbers are the same and seperated by a (<strong class="auto-aircraft">&gt;</strong>), 
	whilst when it is changing altitude, the numbers are different and seperated 
	by a (<strong class="auto-aircraft">^</strong>).</p>
