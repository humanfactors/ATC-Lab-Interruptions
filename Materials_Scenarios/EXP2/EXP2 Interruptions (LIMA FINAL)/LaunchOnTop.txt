ABOUT & USAGE
=============

This tiny program will launch the program specified on its command
line, wait for the program to load, and then it sets the application
window to be "always on top." After that, Launch On Top closes so
that it does not use any system resources.

To use Launch On Top, simply run the executable (LaunchOnTop.exe) with
the program you wish to execute passed as a command-line parameter.
For example, if you wanted to run a copy of Notepad in an "always on
top" sate, you would do this:

  LaunchOnTop notepad.exe

If you need to pass command-line paramters to the program you are
launching, simply append them like this:

  LaunchOnTop notepad.exe c:\windows\win.ini

That's it!
